# SQL-query-to-add-bulk-attributes-to-Woocommerce-Products

We were required add attributes to more than 600 products in the website based on category.
We don't have any plugin or default funcationality for this to bulk add attributes specific to catgeories.

So we dicovered the SQL code to add and then update the count figures.

Hope you will enjoy the code if you are facing the same problem.
Cheers
